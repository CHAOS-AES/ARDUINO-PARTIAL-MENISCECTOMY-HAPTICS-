This folder contains experimental data from a tool-tissue interaction data collection experiment using an Acufex Upbiter Punch. The data was collected from a cadaveric meniscus.

Folders:
PART I: Samples with tape covering FSR sensor. Idea was to get better force distribution over FSR, but ended up biasing measures (force not being zero unloaded).
PART II: Tape was removed. Zero force on zero load, but pay attention to force behavior.

The dataset consists of five columns:
1) fsrReading - this is the raw reading of the force sensitive resistor.
2) fsrForce - this is the fsr-force converted to Newtons from a calibration function.
3) potVal - this is the raw potentiometer reading.
3) anglePres - this is the potentiometer reading converted to degrees.
4) currentMillis - this is the time stamp in milliseconds.
