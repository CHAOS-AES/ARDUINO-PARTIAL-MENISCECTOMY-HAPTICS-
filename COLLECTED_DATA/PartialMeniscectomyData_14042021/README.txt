This folder contains experimental data from a tool-tissue interaction data collection experiment using an Acufex Upbiter Punch. The data was collected from a cadaveric meniscus.

Folders:
PART I: Samples with tape covering FSR sensor. Idea was to get better force distribution over FSR, but ended up biasing measures (force not being zero unloaded).
PART II: Tape was removed. Zero force on zero load, but pay attention to force behavior.
